Tsuki.Framework (In Development)
======

Tsuki.Framework is a large project.

Objective.
======
Fast, low-level C# binding for OpenGL, OpenGL ES, OpenAL, and OpenCL. It runs on all major platforms and powers hundreds of apps, games and scientific research. This framework is designed to give you an ability to develop both your own game engine and an entire game project. Development is not beyond what you wouldn't normally expect from a game framework. Consequently, it has elements such as the basic functionality of the user interface, text rendering, Live2D render, 3D render, advanced input processing (text fields), working with databases, ensuring project security and performance overlays, provided "out of the box". This functionality can be useful for developers of their own game engines and projects.
- Wherever graphical components are implemented, they will be displayed with a common design and will be available for further customization.
- Common elements used by games (texture caching, font loading) will be automatically initialized at runtime.
- The ability to develop components in isolation using a reliable testing environment (`Visual Tests` and `Test Cases`).

Requirements
=======
- A desktop platform with the [.NET 7.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
- When running on Linux, please ensure that you have a system-wide ffmpeg installation available to support video decoding.
- When running on Windows, it is recommended to use Windows 10, 11, 12 latest version
- Is not recommended to use the MacOS platform
- For development, it is recommended to use the IDE JetBrains Rider, Visual Studio Code, or Visual Studio 2022.

Future projects
======
- **Tsuki.Engine** — A video game development game engine based on Tsuki.Framework
- **Project Tsukihime** — A remaster project of an old game project in the novella genre, Tsukihime (2000) + DLC with the developer Tsuki's own vision.Framework using 3D backgrounds and Live2D capabilities.
- **AI Marie Kate** — A project related to the development of its own AI V-Tuber. I can't say anything more :^)

*fork [OpenTK 4.7.6](https://github.com/opentk/opentk/tree/master) with a rethinking of code, this project, to implement more fine-tuning, projects
